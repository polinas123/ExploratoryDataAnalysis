this repo includes code for plotting some exploratory plots from NEI data.
(more information  on the emitions index can be found here: https://www3.epa.gov/ttn/chief/eiinformation.html)

this repo includes 7 files.

read_data.R
-----------
this file contains a function readData(), to read NEI data from the course website.
